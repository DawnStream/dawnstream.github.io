It seems everyone is talking about Mars this days. I'm not sure if it was Elon Musk that started this with his ambitious plans to settle Mars, but regardless who started it, it is the hottest subject in space travel. ESA, the Chinese, and of course NASA have plan to get there in the next 10-15 years. NASA even invested in advertisement: they spent money, and tried everywhere on social media to connect itself with the movie The Martian - in order to make sure Mars is in the public's mind, after all it will help it secure the funds to the trip, if the public was behind it.

Of course Mars makes a lot of sense for permanent human habitation, but isn't is just too early to set our eyes to it? Indeed, humans have already visited the moon, our closest neighbor, which I guess makes it mundane and not exciting, but the moon should still be the target of our current efforts. There is still a lot of science that can done on it, teaching us more about the processes that shaped it and our own home planet. But the most important thing we can do with the moon, is use it as our stepping stone on our way further away.

We can learn a great deal about space operations during missions to the moon. Just as the Gemini program in orbit around earth taught us and prepared us the necessary capabilities to maneuver and dock in space, in order to do that around the moon, maneuvers and technics used on the moon can prepare us to the next challenges. Although the moon as no atmosphere, and much lower gravity than earth or Mars, it can be used to train for operations such as mining asteroids. It has resources that can be extracted and used to fuel spaceships going to Mars. ([http://www.space.com/28189-moon-mining-economic-feasibility.html]())

The short distance to the moon means shorter mission times. The trip to Mars can take anywhere between 4 and 10 months, depending on the relative locations of the two planets, so even the short trip time may be relevant only a few months in the future. The moon on the other hand, is 3 days away, and it is basically the same time regardless of when you want to go. This means less fuel is needed to get any needed provisions, faster reaction time to any crisis that may arise. Of course the close proximity also means faster communications, with only about 1 second delay (the communication delay to Mars is changes between 4 and 24 minutes - for just one way).

Still, some people haven't forgotten silver-tipping neighbor. [The Google Lunar X-prize](http://lunar.xprize.org/) tries to incentivize people to build moon-faring rovers. In doing so they hope to atract the private industry and create affordable access to the moon and its resources. Currenty 16 teams from around the world are still in the race to be the winners of the $30 million prize.

Building a permanent colony on Mars can save human kind from disaster on earth. But in order to achieve this goal, we need to set our eyes closer, developing the technology to make space access affordable, building the processes and technoques that will allow us work on remote, harsh environments. First, we need to go to the moon.
