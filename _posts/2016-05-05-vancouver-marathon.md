This last Sunday I ran the Vancouver marathon. I was aiming at a BQ qualifying time of 3:07 (my qualifying time is 3:10, I wanted 3 minutes cushion to make sure I can get in). It was a very tough goal for me, as my PR is 3:11:48, which I ran on a great day when everything connected. Now I needed to improve my PR by 5 minutes, on a very different course, and the weather foecast predicted less than ideal conditions. Regardless, I tried to prepare my self mentally to work hard during the race, and was ready to suffer in order to reach my goal.

I arrived to Vancouver on Friday, and had a chance to get to the expo and pick up my bib that afternoon. We enjoyed the city, and walked around quite a bit, maybe a little more than I would like. Saturday morning we went on a 3 mile shake-out run, and most of the day was spent relaxing, napping and not doing too much. In the afternoon my legs felt tired and even hurt a little, but I tried not to think about it too much, staying confident in my readiness to the race. An early dinner (Lasagna and beets salad) closed the day. Similar to what I did in Philadelphia, I kept hydrating the whole day (water and Nuun), but with dinner I stopped hydrating, not wanting to need to go to the bathroom too often in the morning.

In the morning we took the train to the start line, checked bags and got ready to run. It was nice and chilly in the shade, but started to feel a little warm in the sun, even without running. We started the run at 8:30, and I set to run my plan of even splits of 7:08 as soon as I could. I tried not to start too fast and excited, but except my watch (which gave me some pace errors the last few weeks, so I didn't trust too much), the only pace indication was the 3:00 pacer, who started *really* slow, so I ended running in fromt of him the first mile. At this stage, with a slight downhill, I tried to maintain my pace, letting the 3:00 group pass me and kept my distance.

The plan seemed to work fine, my average pace ws exactly where I wanted it to be, slowing a little on the uphills and catching back on the downhills. This continued through the last big downhill, coming down from UBC toward the half way mark. Although it was still too early to think about the end of the race, I really felt well enough to believe I'll get my BQ.

Although at this stage we ran along the beach line, there were 2 small hills I didn't paid attention to when looking at the course profile. Although not big or long, they were enough to tire me, and I needed to slow down a bit - not a big deal, as I was still passing some runners. Then we got to the Burrard st. bridge, again a small uphill, but even coming down it, I didn't really recovered, and kept getting tired. At this point we got to the seawall, it was about mile 20, and there were no more crowds. A slight head wind on the first section of the seawall didn't help, and I felt I was fading away, finding it difficult to keep my pace.

The suffering I expected and readied myself to, has arrived. With every step it became harder to make the next one. Even using my fourth and last gel, which originally was only meant for backup, didn't seem to help. I kept fighting to keep on running, although my legs screamed that I should walk. I slowed down to about 7:50 pace, feeling very tired. At about 3 miles to go, my teammates Nadia and Meg, who set out to run 3:10, passed me, and I couldn't stick with them. About mile 25 I broke down and walk for about a quarter of a mile, but then kept running. A few more turns and I was off the seawall, and back on the street running toward the finish line. At first I tried to sprint it, as I usually try, but then I realized that there was no chance to break my PR, so I just eased and crossed the line, at 3:13:19.

I missed my goal by 6 minutes. I felt terrible and cursed with disappointment as I missed my goal and wasn't able to get a new PR. Then I remembered that I fought and suffered and executed a gutsy plan, and I was proud of myself. In all my marathons in the past I didn't handle the suffering well, but this time I felt I improved significantly. The marathon is **hard**, and we can't expect to succeed and improve every time. We have to believe in ourselves and our training, and then go out there and give everything we have. And maybe we won't get the results we expected.

The important thing for me is to review my race and make sure I have some takeaways, so I can keep on improving:

- Improve my hydration plan - I used the same plan I used in Philadelphia, but with the 15 degrees difference I didn't get enough water, and I think dehydration contributed to my fading. I need to run with 2 bottles on warmer races
- Mental readiness - I was much better than previous races, but this is an area I can still improve
- Pace on uphills - I think I should run slower on the uphills. I pass a lot of people going up, but than I feel I need to really slow down and recover.

Now I need to reassess my plans. I wanted to run the 2017 Boston marathon. It is the day before my 40th birthday, and I wanted to make the trip to Boston a big birthday thing. I can still try and run a last chance race in September, but I don't feel like training really hard during the summer heat in Austin. Aiming for Boston 2018 should be easier, I just need to repeat my PR, which is good enough to get me in once I'm 40. Any recommendations for my next marathon?
