This last Saturday was the last long workout, in preparation for the Vancouver marathon. It was 16 miles that included 2 sections of running at MGP (marathon goal pace), with an easy mile between them. I hit the pace I plan for Vancouver - 7:05 min./mile, in order to run sub 3:07. This means a 5 minute PR compared to my last, the Philadelphia marathon I ran last November.

To me, this training cycle has seen many ups and downs. I was consistent in January, but had hard time getting up in the morning I don't run with my teammates at Rogue, so overall ran relatively low mileage. Than in February I suffered from pain in my abdominal area that fell to me like a hernia. The doctor's exam and the following CT scan didn't find anything, but still I didn't run for 10 days, including the long workout on the Austin marathon course. Those 10 days were really hard as I worried I won't be able to run Vancouver.

After I recovered, I completed the workouts, including a 30 miler non-fuel run. But at that time some "real life" issues surfaced, and again it was hard to complete the workouts, and I just lost some focus on the target. After very tough 3 weeks, things improved, and I was back trying to churn the miles. With 3 weeks to go, I ran the cap 10k with the goal of running sub 40 minutes. Although my teammates were able to reach that goal, I couldn't. I ran 40:20, which is a big PR, but I missed my goal. I ran on tired legs after a long week of workouts, which was the longest week in over a month. Overall the results were good, but my confidence is shaky.

So there are 2 more weeks left. This is the hard part where you can't do much to improve your speed or fitness, but you can do a lot to make sure you mentally prepared to the race. It is important to __trust the taper__, let your body recover and get it ready for the big day. I'm working of overcoming my fears of not be as fast as I want to. On race day I plan to trust my body to do what I prepared it to do, and just go for my ambitious goal. With some good weather, the right hydration plan and overcoming the pain and suffering, I'll be able to do it. There is a good chance I won't, but it won't be due to lack of trying. I'm sure that in any case it will be a great adventure, and I plan to enjoy it as much as I can.
